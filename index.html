				<p>
					Join our weekly sessions to talk about CSE courses
					and the impacts of cutting-edge computing topics over free food.
					CSE-PACE is free, designed for all first-year computing
					students, and runs for the entire academic year.
					Earn 2 units of credit each quarter for participation by 
					enrolling in CSE 89: Intro to CSE Seminar.
					<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeL1-IsamYi_UeIBkDtozQFHk-VExRdb-kzifXFjspWgA26Yg/viewform">Register first</a> to help us make
					groups ahead of time. Or, if you show up in
					CSE 2154 on Wednesday or Friday during cohort time during the first few weeks of
					the Fall quarter, we'll help you get started!
				</p>
	
				<p><b>Q: What will I do in a CSE-PACE session?</b><br>
					Meet in a group with 8-10 other students and  
							your lead peer mentor to talk about computing in the news,
							do a hands-on project, visit a cool place on
							campus, or try out something you're using in your classes.
					</p>
					<p><b>Q: Will I get credit?</b><br>
					Enroll in CSE 89 to earn course credits as part of participation in CSE-PACE. This 
					course may count towards the lower division elective for CSE majors.
					</p>
					<p><b>Q: How do I join?</b><br>
					Come by CSE (EBU3b) 2154j during the Wednesday or Friday cohort time  anytime this Fall quarter
					and we will help you get set up. To let us know you're interested ahead of time,
					fill out the <a href="">registration</a> form and add CSE 89 to your class schedule.<br>
					<ul>
						<li>You might be able to enroll in CSE 89 directly on TritonLink.</li>
						<li>If not, add yourself to the waitlist, and check your @ucsd.edu email for instructions.</li>
						<li>Either way, come by during the class time so we can get you started.</li>
