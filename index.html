			<div class="col-lg-10 explanation">
				<p><b>Q: What will I do in a CSE-PACE session?</b><br>
					A typical session will have each 8-10 person 
							cohort and their lead peer mentor talk about a video/ news 
							article related to the cohort theme, do an activity on 
							campus, or try out something you're using in your classes.
					</p>
					<p><b>Q: Will I get credit?</b><br>
					We encourage students participating in 
								CSE-PACE to add CSE 91 to their schedule so that they 
								can earn course credits as part of participation in 
								the program.
					</p>
					<p><b>Q: How do I join?</b><br>
					You can come by CSE (EBU3b) 1202 during the Thursday cohort time or CSE 4140 during the Friday cohort time in Spring quarter and we'll help 
					you get set up. To let us know you're interested ahead of time,
					fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/w8N9NwH5Zy4dHMau5">registration</a> form and add CSE 91 to your class schedule.<br>
					<ol>
						<li>In order to give priority to incoming CSE students in cohorts, we've 
							set it up so everyone enrolls through the waitlist and then we admit 
							people from there. So enrolling via the waitlist is just the right 
							thing to do!</li>
						<li>You should pick one of the two Spring quarter times (Thursday or Friday) 
							to attend CSE-PACE, not both. You will pick this by adding the 
							corresponding lecture section when you enroll.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
				First-year CSE students are organized into
				cohorts led by an experienced CSE undergraduate tutor.
				</p>	
				<p>
				<a href="#team">Meet the team!</a>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Join our weekly hour-long sessions to talk about CSE courses
				and the impacts of cutting-edge computing topics over free food.
				</p>

				<p>
				CSE-PACE is free, designed for all first-year computing
				students, and runs for the entire academic year.
				</p>

				<p>
					Earn 2 units of credit for participation by 
					enrolling in CSE 91: Perspectives in CSE during Spring quarter
					(or CSE 90 if you already have CSE 91 credit).
					Priority enrollment to CSE majors.
					Discussion attendance is optional; don't worry about scheduling
					conflicts between the CSE 91 Discussion time and your other classes.
				</p>

				<p><a href="https://forms.gle/w8N9NwH5Zy4dHMau5">Register first</a> to help us make
				groups ahead of time. Or, if you show up in
				CSE 1202 on Thursday at 2:00pm
				or in CSE 4140 on Friday at 2:00pm during the first few weeks of
				the Spring quarter, we'll help you get started!</p>
